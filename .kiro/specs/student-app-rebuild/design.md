# Design Document

## Overview

The Student-on-the-Go app will be rebuilt as a modern React Native application using the latest Expo SDK (52.x), Firebase v11.x for backend services, and contemporary UI libraries. The architecture emphasizes performance, maintainability, and user experience while preserving all existing functionality.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework:**

- React Native 0.76.x with Expo SDK 52.x
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- React Navigation 7.x for navigation management

**UI/UX Libraries:**

- NativeBase 3.x or Tamagui for modern, accessible UI components
- React Native Reanimated 3.x for smooth animations
- React Native Gesture Handler for enhanced touch interactions
- Expo Vector Icons for consistent iconography

**Backend Services:**

- Firebase v11.x (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- Firebase Auth for user authentication with email/password
- Firestore for real-time chat and data storage
- Firebase Storage for faculty images and assets

**State Management:**

- Zustand for lightweight, modern state management
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and caching

**Development Tools:**

- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Husky for git hooks
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

## Data Models

### User Model

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date;
}
```

### Chat Models

```typescript
interface ChatRoom {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  participantCount: number;
}

interface Message {
  id: string;
  chatRoomId: string;
  userId: string;
  userDisplayName: string;
  userEmail: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'file';
}
```

### Faculty Model

```typescript
interface FacultyMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;

  imageUrl: string;
  program: 'cyber-security' | 'data-science' | 'both';
  department?: string;
}
```
