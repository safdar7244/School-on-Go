# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing an existing React Native Expo project by updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions, resolving any compatibility issues, and ensuring the project runs properly with the updated packages. The project appears to be a student-focused mobile application with navigation, Firebase integration, and UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project dependencies updated to their latest stable versions, so that the project benefits from security patches, performance improvements, and new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current package.json THEN the system SHALL identify all outdated dependencies
2. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable versions compatible with the current Expo SDK
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility between all packages
4. IF a dependency has breaking changes THEN the system SHALL document required code modifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deprecated packages replaced with their modern equivalents, so that the project uses currently maintained libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering deprecated packages THEN the system SHALL identify modern replacement packages
2. WHEN replacing deprecated packages THEN the system SHALL update all import statements and usage
3. WHEN replacing packages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality
4. IF no direct replacement exists THEN the system SHALL document alternative approaches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to build and run successfully after updates, so that development can continue without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all packages are updated THEN the project SHALL build without errors
2. WHEN running the project THEN all screens SHALL load without crashes
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN all routes SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN testing Firebase integration THEN authentication and data operations SHALL function properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want any breaking changes documented and resolved, so that I understand what changed and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering breaking changes THEN the system SHALL document each change and its impact
2. WHEN resolving breaking changes THEN the system SHALL update affected code files
3. WHEN making code changes THEN the system SHALL preserve existing functionality
4. WHEN updates are complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes made

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package.json scripts and configuration to work with updated dependencies, so that development workflows remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating packages THEN all npm/yarn scripts SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN updating Expo SDK THEN the app.json configuration SHALL be compatible
3. WHEN updating build tools THEN the babel.config.js SHALL work with new versions
4. IF configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL update config files accordingly
